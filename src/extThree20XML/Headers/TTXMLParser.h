/**
 * An implementation of the NSXMLParser object that turns XML into NSObjects.
 *
 * Uses a simple stack-based traversal of the XML document to recursively create the objects
 * at each level. Upon successful completion, rootObject will be an NSDictionary object.
 *
 * To traverse the resulting NSObject hierarchy, use the NSDictionary additions provided at the end
 * of this file to access the XML entity name, type, and object. For example:
 *
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 * <issues type="array">
 *  <issue>
 *    <number type="integer">3</number>
 *  </issue>
 *  <issue>
 *    <number type="integer">10</number>
 *  </issue>
 * </issues>
 *
 * Logic to parse the above XML as an NSData* object:
 *
 *     TTXMLParser* parser = [[TTXMLParser alloc] initWithData:xmlData];
 *     [parser parse];
 *
 * parser.rootObject will become the following NSObject:
 *
 * rootObject => NSDictionary* (root)
 *          <key>         <value>
 *  - ___Entity_Name___:  "issues"
 *  - ___Entity_Type___:  "array"
 *  - ___Entity_Value___: NSArray of NSDictionaries, accessed with [rootObject objectForXMLNode]
 *
 * [rootObject objectForXMLNode] => NSArray* of NSDictionaries
 * Each item of the NSArray is an NSDictionary*:
 * foreach item in array:
 *   - ___Entity_Name___:  "issue"
 *   - ___Entity_Type___:  kCommonXMLType_Unknown
 *   - ___Entity_Value___: NSDictionary*
 * etc...
 *
 * Implementation note: This class is designed as a simple means of parsing XML documents. It has
 * not been optimized for speed or memory usage, and has only been tested with documents less than
 * one MB (megabyte) in size.
