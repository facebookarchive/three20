 @brief How many levels to skip
 
 This is useful for parsing HUGE JSON documents, particularly if it consists of an
 outer array and multiple objects.
 
 If you set this to N it will skip the outer N levels and call the -parser:foundArray:
 or -parser:foundObject: methods for each of the inner objects, as appropriate.
