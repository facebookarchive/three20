 * run/continue a lex. "offset" is an input/output parameter.

 * new chunk of target text, and upon subsetquent calls with the same
 * target text should passed with the value of the previous invocation.
 *
 * the client may be interested in the value of offset when an error is
 * returned from the lexer.  This allows the client to render useful
n * error messages.
 *
 * When you pass the next chunk of data, context should be reinitialized
 * to zero.
 *
 * Finally, the output buffer is usually just a pointer into the jsonText,
 * however in cases where the entity being lexed spans multiple chunks,
 * the lexer will buffer the entity and the data returned will be
 * a pointer into that buffer.
 *
 * This behavior is abstracted from client code except for the performance
 * implications which require that the client choose a reasonable chunk
 * size to get adequate performance.
