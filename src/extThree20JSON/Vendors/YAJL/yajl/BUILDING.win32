YAJL has been successfully built using Visual Studio 8.  CMake is used to 
build the software and by specifying a generator explicitly at cmake:

1. acquire cmake (http://www.cmake.org)
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake ..
5. devenv YetAnotherJSONParser.sln /project ALL_BUILD /build Release
6. build output is left in build/yajl-X.Y.Z

Earlier versions of visual studio have not been tested, but should 
work without any major issues.
