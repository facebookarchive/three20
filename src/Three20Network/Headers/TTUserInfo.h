/**
 * A helper class for storing user info to help identify a request.
 *
 * This class lets you store both a strong reference and a weak reference for the duration of
 * the request.  The weak reference is special because TTURLRequestQueue will examine it when
 * you call cancelRequestsWithDelegate to see if the weak object is the delegate in question.
 * For this reason, this object is a safe way to store an object that may be destroyed before
 * the request completes if you call cancelRequestsWithDelegate in the object's destructor.
