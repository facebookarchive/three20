Using extThree20Google
======================

<pre><code>
// Initialize
GDirections *directions = [[GDirections alloc] init];

// Register as delegate. This lets us know when the direction is loaded. Self must conform to TTRemoteDelegate.
[directions registerDelegate:self];

// To from can be given as a string or CLLocation
CLLocation *presentLocation;

// Get directions, delegate is called on successful load. Waypoints are ignored.
[directions loadDirectionsFrom:presentLocation
                            to:@"1 Infinite Loop"
                     waypoints:nil];

</code></pre>

And below is the remote delegate callback:

<pre><code>

	- (void)remoteObject:(TTRemoteObject *)remoteObject didFinishLoadForRequest:(TTURLRequest *)request {
    		// remoteObject is GDirections object that we instantiated in the code above. It has all the routes, legs and steps.
    		GRoute *route = [directions.routes.objects objectAtIndex:0];
    
		for (int i = 0; i < route.legs.objects.count; i++ ) {
			GRouteLeg *leg = [route.legs.objects objectAtIndex:i];

			for ( int j = 0; j < leg.steps.objects.count; j++ ) {
				GRouteStep *step = [leg.steps.objects objectAtIndex:j];
			}
		}
	}

</code></pre>
