 * navigator in the app at a time, and the window will always own the root controller.
 *
 * On the iPad there are a variety of implementations that require multiple
 * navigators to exist simultaneously. With a split-view design, for example, one might have
 * two controllers on the screen simultaneously, each with their own TTNavigator mapping.
 *
 * If no root container is specified for a TTNavigator, the key window will be assumed as the
